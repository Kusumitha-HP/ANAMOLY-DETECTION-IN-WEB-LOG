Designed and developed an intelligent anomaly detection system to analyze high-volume e-commerce web logs and detect security threats such as brute-force attacks and abnormal response time patterns.

Implemented machine learning models (Isolation Forest) and deep learning architectures (LSTM, Autoencoder) for accurate anomaly identification.

Built a real-time interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize anomalies, monitor system behavior, and provide actionable insights.

Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and log pattern analysis using Pandas and NumPy to enhance model performance.

Deployed the solution as a scalable prototype capable of handling large-scale log data efficiently.
